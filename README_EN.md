# UI-kit for porfolio project

> Этот текст в русском переводе находится [здесь](https://github.com/Nmgix/nmgix-components/blob/main/README.md)

The urgent need for a separate UI kit came with the realization that I was tired of having both components and logic together in one place.
When creating a portfolio, I won't be able to break the component in other places (of course, if I try enough, I can) of the project. If I need to create a separate case (for example, an unusual button), I can make a separate component based on generic one from kit for a specific purpose.
Maybe this UI library in the future will become fundamental not only for this project.
